No CSS or HTML validation errors!

### CSS
Mostly used own CSS for changing colours, backgrounds. Bootstrap CSS libraries heavily used for positioning and layout.
- Changed inner column background colour to #e2e097
- Added wood-grain background image to outer columns
- Changed navbar colour to #ea1b23
- Changed navbar text colour to "whitesmoke"
- Added shadow below navbar to create depth effect
- Added text shadow to carousel text to increase text visibility on top of image
- For some reason the body of my page was overflowing past my navbar, so added ```overflow-x:hidden;``` to fix
- Changed font and positioning for Gallery page

### JavaScript
Bootstrap JavaScript libraries heavily used on Menu page
- Used a script to prevent users from selecting a date earlier than the current date on Contact Us page
- Photoswipe gallery on Gallery page

### If I Had Unlimited Time

- Would have taken own pictures for gallery, carousel, etc. This would have given me more control over the quality of pictures I was using, and allow me to resize them to the size I wanted without sacrificing image quality or ruining the aspect ratio.
- Spent some more time making the text content on my page a bit flashier. It is concise and gets the intended message across but is kind of boring.
- Create some word art for the name of the restaurant in the nav bar.
- Would have taken some time to chat with the business owner and get some more info about the restaurant so I could make an About page.

### Colours
I used a colour picker on Baby Salsa's Logo to come up with the colour scheme for the site. Here is a screenshot of the colour palette I used:

### Other Features I'd Add
- I would have loved to have added some more JavaScript elements to my website, I wanted to add a screen to order delivery directly from the site, but couldn't find anything from SkipTheDishes.
